        <p>
            Founded in 2014, Lirah’s glow organics is a boutique 
skincare company based in Polokwane, South Africa. The 
company started with handmade organic soaps and 
quickly grew into a full range of natural, cruelty-free 
skincare products. Lirah’s glow sources ingredients 
locally, supports sustainable farming, and is committed to 
zero-waste packaging.
